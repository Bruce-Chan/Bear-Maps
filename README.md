Bear-Maps
=========
## Berkeley CS61B Project 3 (inspired by Google Maps)

This is a web mapping application of berkeley.

I developed the backend of it using Java, Apache Maven, AWS.

This application can handle features such as query autocomplete responses, place searching,
map displaying, zooming in/out, and finding the shortest path between to user-inputted points.
